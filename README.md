# Power BI Learning Journey

Welcome to my Power BI Learning Journey repository! This project is dedicated to documenting my process of learning and mastering the powerful business intelligence tool, Power BI.

Here, I'll be sharing:

*   **Tutorials:** Projects I've made following tutorials on concepts I'm learning, from basic data connection and transformation to advanced DAX calculations and data modeling.
*   **Projects:** Practical examples and projects where I apply my Power BI skills to real-world datasets.
*   **Resources:** Resrouces i've used for my learning journey

My goal is to create a comprehensive record of my progress, which can also serve as a resource for others beginning their Power BI journey.

## Contents

*   `/tutorials`: Contains markdown files covering specific Power BI features and techniques.
*   `/projects`: Houses individual project folders with their respective data, Power BI files (`.pbix`), and documentation.
