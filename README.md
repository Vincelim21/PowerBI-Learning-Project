# Power BI Learning Journey

Welcome to my Power BI Learning Journey repository! This project is dedicated to documenting my process of learning and mastering the powerful business intelligence tool, Power BI.

Here, I'll be sharing:

*   **Tutorials:** Step-by-step guides and notes on concepts I'm learning, from basic data connection and transformation to advanced DAX calculations and data modeling.
*   **Projects:** Practical examples and projects where I apply my Power BI skills to real-world datasets.
*   **Resources:** Links to helpful articles, videos, and other resources I find valuable along the way.

My goal is to create a comprehensive record of my progress, which can also serve as a resource for others beginning their Power BI journey.

## Contents

*   `/tutorials`: Contains markdown files and notebooks covering specific Power BI features and techniques.
*   `/projects`: Houses individual project folders with their respective data, Power BI files (`.pbix`), and documentation.
*   `/resources`: A collection of links and references to external learning materials.
